## 8.3 LATE ORDER FEES

calculated at the prevailing prime rate plus one percent of the value of the Cargo Dues
Order. The following example illustrates this calculation:
Prime Rate: 9.0%
Prime Rate plus 1% = 10.0%
Value of Order R10 000
Number of days late: 14
Interest Calculation (10.0% x (14/365)) = R38.37
Total Cargo Dues Payable R10 038.37
The first public holiday and first weekend will be excluded if it falls within the number of
days that the Order has been submitted late for purposes of interest calculation.
8.3.2 Non-submission of Cargo Dues Orders
The Authority will apply an incremental late order fee based on the cargo dues payable
and dependent on how late documentation is submitted or when a non-submission is dis-
covered by the Authority’s internal verification process. Refer below for late order applica-
tion:
